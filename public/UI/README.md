## Prizes Component
This component requires GSAP Scrolltrigger and ThreeJS to work. When the user scrolls in, the first trophy rotates and the text fades in. Then from behind the 1st trophy, the second trophy goes to the left. Then, the third trophy behind the first trophy goes to the right. This first happens for the first trophy and then the second trophy and then the third trophy.

## Leaderboard Page
Leaderboard should contain the top 3 players in huge divs, and the rest of the players in a list. The top 3 players should have a different design than the rest of the players. Every time there's an update in the leaderboard, the boxes should be animated by moving up and down. (Optional: There should be a smooth transition from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd to the rest. For example, Whenever an user goes from 4th to 3rd, the 3rd player should move to 4th and the 4th player should move to 3rd with a smooth transition)

## Round - 2
The team names must be distributed in a random format in the map. The team names should be clickable and should show the Questions they have. When clicked on the start button, it should convert itself to enigma-yellow(#eab308) show starting until the backend gives the links. When we get the request, the start button turns into an input to type the flag, with a smooth transition to the right and the "STARTING" turns into a Stop icon.
